# moebot.audio
A chatbot that sorts through live recordings of the band moe.

www.moebot.audio

Goals
 - Sort through the enormous volume of live moe. recordings
 - Source stories directly from fans
 - Create a codebase that be used for other bands too
 
This bot is my first attempt at creating a conversational interface for music distribution. Worded in a less robotic way, this bot loves the band moe., tries to learn why fans love moe. by chatting with them about the live recordings stored on archive.org. Eventually once moe.bot currates enough amazing recordings and stories from fans, it will spread the love of moe. to new moe.rons and contribute to the creation of a moe.topia where the only thing anyone eats is moe.caroni and cheese.

For real though, this bot concept could be made for any band, musician, or artist. It could be used for videos, images, and music.
